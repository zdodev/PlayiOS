# Handling Different Data Types in Core Data
Create, store, and present records for a variety of data types.

## Overview
Many apps need to persist and present different kinds of information. Core Data provides different attributes, including those common for all databases, such as `Date` or `Decimal` type, and non-standard attributes handled with `Transformable` type. It also provides `Transient` and `Derived` attributes so apps can derive one piece of data from the other.

This sample shows how to handle all these data types, by creating and presenting a set of book records. After you launch it, this sample automatically generates the records if they don't already exist, and shows them in a list. The records are grouped by their published month and can be searched with their canonical form of title. 

## Derive a Non-Persistent Value Using a Transient Attribute
A `Transient` attribute is derived from one or multiple stored attributes in the same entity. As its name implies, a `Transient` attribute isn't persisted to the store, so an app can use it to provide a new attribute based on the stored ones, without consuming extra storage space.

To make an attribute `Transient`, select the Core Data model in Xcode Project Navigator, navigate to the Core Data entity, select the attribute in the attributes list, and check the `Transient` box in the Data Model Inspector.

In this sample, `publishMonthID` is a `Transient` attribute derived from `publishDate`. To implement the derivation, this sample provides a custom accessor for `publishDate` and `publishMonthID`. The `setter` method of `publishDate` nullifies `primitivePublishMonthID`, which allows the `getter` method of `publishMonthID` to recalculate the value based on the current `publishDate`.  

``` swift
@objc public var publishDate: Date? {
    get {
        willAccessValue(forKey: Name.publishDate)
        defer { didAccessValue(forKey: Name.publishDate) }
        return primitivePublishDate
    }
    set {
        willChangeValue(forKey: Name.publishDate)
        defer { didChangeValue(forKey: Name.publishDate) }
        primitivePublishDate = newValue
        primitivePublishMonthID = nil
    }
}
```

The `getter` method of `publishMonthID` recalculates the value if `primitivePublishMonthID` is nil.

``` swift
@objc public var publishMonthID: String? {
    willAccessValue(forKey: Name.publishMonthID)
    defer { didAccessValue(forKey: Name.publishMonthID) }
    
    guard primitivePublishMonthID == nil, let date = primitivePublishDate else {
        return primitivePublishMonthID
    }
    let calendar = Calendar(identifier: .gregorian)
    let components = calendar.dateComponents([.year, .month], from: date)
    if let year = components.year, let month = components.month {
        primitivePublishMonthID = "\(year * 1000 + month)"
    }
    return primitivePublishMonthID
}
```

With these two methods, `publishMonthID` is associated with `publishDate` and always stays current.

In the case where `publishMonthID` is [`key-value observed`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/cocoa_design_patterns/using_key-value_observing_in_swift), the following code ensures that the observations are triggered when `publishDate` changes.

``` swift
class func keyPathsForValuesAffectingPublishMonthID() -> Set<String> {
    return [Name.publishDate]
}
```

## Derive One Value From Another Using a Derived Attribute
This sample uses a `Derived` attribute, `canonicalTitle`, to support searching the canonical form of book titles. `canonicalTitle` is configured as the canonical form of  `title` by setting the following expression as the value of the `Derivation` field shown Xcode's Data Model Inspector.

    canonical:(title)

`Derived` attributes are used in cases where performance is more critical than storage space. In this sample, the app gets the same result by setting up a predicate with  `CONTAINS[cd]` ( where `cd` means case- and diacritic-insensitive ) to search `title` directly. By searching `canonicalTitle` which is persisted, the app performs more quickly because it doesn't need to do diacritic-insensitive comparison for every book title.
 
 `Derived` attributes are only updated when the user saves the managed context. Concretely, `canonicalTitle` won't change if the sample app changes the `title` attribute without saving it.

## Configure and Implement a Non-Standard Data Type
`Transformable` attributes store objects with a non-standard type, or a type that isn't in the attribute type list in Xcode's Data Model Inspector. To implement a `Transformable` attribute, configure it by setting its type to `Transformable` and specifying the transformer and custom class name in Data Model Inspector, then register a transformer with code before an app loads its Core Data stack.

``` swift
// Register the transformer at the very beginning.
// .colorToDataTransformer is a name defined with an NSValueTransformerName extension.
ValueTransformer.setValueTransformer(ColorToDataTransformer(), forName: .colorToDataTransformer)
```
 
 Core Data requires the transformer be `NSSecureUnarchiveFromData` or its subclass, and that its `transformedValue(_:)` method converts a `Data` object to an instance of the custom class specified in Data Model Inspector and that `reverseTransformedValue(_:)` does the opposite – converts an instance of the custom class to a `Data` object.
 
## Store and Present a Date Type
In a Core Data store, a `Date` attribute is a `double` value that represents a number of seconds since 1970. Using a variety of calendars, time zones, and locales, an app can convert a `Date` value to different date strings, or convert a date string to different `Date` values. When parsing a date string, configure the `DateFormatter` with the right calendar, time zone, and locale. Typically, if the string is generated by the current user, the user-perceived calendar, time zone, and locale will be the current system ones, so an app can use a default `DateFormatter` instance. In other cases, configure `DateFormatter` in the same way the app generated the string.

## Store and Present a Decimal Type
This sample uses a `Decimal` attribute to represent the book price, which is then mapped to a variable of `NSDecimalNumber` type. `NSDecimalNumber` has a convenient method to process a currency value. 

``` swift
newBook.price = NSDecimalNumber(mantissa: value, exponent: -2, isNegative: false)
```

`NSDecimalNumber` also provides a convenient way to present a value with locale in mind.

``` swift
cell.price.text = book.price?.description(withLocale: Locale.current)
```
